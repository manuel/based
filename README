Requires a recent (~ 1.4) libevent.  "Tested" on Debian stable.

The quick rundown:

sh compile.sh
,/based -p 8080
wget --post-file TODO localhost:8080/todo
wget localhost:8080/todo

You can POST files to arbitrary paths on the server,
e.g. localhost:8080/docs/john_doe/hello-world, and GET them back
later.

The internal data structures consists of an append-only log, and a RAM
index which maps document IDs to offset/length pairs (struct
base_extent) in the log file.

An entry in the log (struct base_entry) consists of a head and a
content.  The head is made up of headers (struct base_header),
currently there is only one header, that stores the ID.  Soon there
will be stuff like MIME type etc.
