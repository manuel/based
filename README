Requires a recent (~ 1.4) libevent.  "Tested" on Debian stable.

The quick rundown:

sh compile.sh
,/based -p 8080
wget --post-file TODO localhost:8080/todo
wget localhost:8080/todo

You can POST files to arbitrary paths on the server,
e.g. localhost:8080/docs/john_doe/hello-world, and GET them back
later.
